Different Games Using Python
## 🔠 Letter Guessing Game
#### 🖥️ Terminal Version
The terminal version is a Python-based game that runs in the command line. It randomly selects a letter from A to Z, and the user guesses it by typing one letter at a time. The game gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low in the alphabet. It tracks the number of attempts and allows the user to play again after a correct guess.

#### 🌐 Web Version
The web version is built using the Flask framework. It provides a simple web interface where users can enter their guesses through an input form. The server handles the game logic and uses session variables to store the secret letter and number of attempts. The page updates with feedback messages and offers a "Play Again" option when the game ends.

## 🎮 Brick Breaker Game (Python + Pygame)
#### Old Version 🟦🟨🔴
Bricks Breaker is a simple block-breaking game built using Pygame. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen by moving the paddle left or right and must bounce a ball to destroy all blocks. The game ends if the ball falls below the paddle.
#### New Version 🟦🟩🟨🟧🟥🔴
This is a simple Brick Breaker game built with Python and Pygame, where you control a paddle to bounce a ball and break rows of colorful bricks. The ball moves automatically, bouncing off walls, bricks, and the paddle. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle and prevent the ball from falling. Each broken brick increases your score, and you have 3 lives to complete the game. The game ends when all bricks are destroyed (you win) or all lives are lost (game over).

## 🟦🔴Ball Dodge Game
This is a simple arcade-style game built using Pygame. The player controls a blue rectangle at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys, aiming to avoid red balls that fall from the top. Each ball moves downward at a random speed and spawns in random positions. If any ball collides with the player, a "GAME OVER" message is displayed and the game ends after a short pause.
