Different Games Using Python
## 🔠 Letter Guessing Game
#### 🖥️ Terminal Version
The terminal version is a Python-based game that runs in the command line. It randomly selects a letter from A to Z, and the user guesses it by typing one letter at a time. The game gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low in the alphabet. It tracks the number of attempts and allows the user to play again after a correct guess.

#### 🌐 Web Version
The web version is built using the Flask framework. It provides a simple web interface where users can enter their guesses through an input form. The server handles the game logic and uses session variables to store the secret letter and number of attempts. The page updates with feedback messages and offers a "Play Again" option when the game ends.
